# 🤖 CHATBOT

This is a simple, fun, and interactive **rule-based chatbot** built using Python's `if-elif-else` control flow — as part of an internship project.

## 🎯 Objective

A chatbot that can simulate human-like conversation using pre-defined rules based on user input.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

- Control Flow (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`while True`)
- Input/Output Handling
- String Matching
- Basic NLP structure (rule-based)

---

## 🚀 Features
